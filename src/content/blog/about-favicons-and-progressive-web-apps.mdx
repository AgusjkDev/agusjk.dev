Have you ever wondered how many favicons you need for your website and what each one is for? I'm pretty sure your answer is `yes`, so today we are going to learn about them.

Favicons have a lot to do with Progressive Web Apps, so please stay tuned.

### How many favicons does my website need?

It depends in what devices you want to support. But we could say **between 3 and 24**.

WAIT?!?!?! 24??? HOW???

Relax, I know, that's a lot for favicons, just let me explain it to you. At the time this article is being written, there is four major "categories".

- Apple: 10 favicons
- Google & Chrome: 5 favicons
- Internet Explorer: 1 favicon
- Windows 8.1: 4 favicons

There is 5 missing favicons there, the classic `favicon.ico`, an optional `favicon.svg` and the remaining three are just an old web standard. Wait, did I just say 5? That is 25! Yep, thats because one of the Google & Chrome and Windows 8.1 favicons are the same size, so we can at least re-use them.

### The favicons sizes

Previously we talked about the four favicons categories, now we are going to see all the sizes and what each one is for.

0. #### Standard:
    - 16x16: All standard browsers
    - 32x32: All standard browsers
    - 64x64: Future use for most standard browsers

1. #### Apple:
    - 57x57: iPod touch & iPhone up to 3G
    - 60x60: iPhone touch up to iOS7
    - 72x72: iPad touch up to iOS6
    - 76x76: iPad touch with iOS7+
    - 114x114: iPhone retina touch up to iOS6
    - 120x120: Phone retina touch with iOS7+
    - 144x144: iPad retina up to iOS6
    - 152x152: iPad retina touch with iOS7+
    - 167x167: iPad retina &#40;newer models&#41;
    - 180x180: iPhone retina &#40;newer models&#41;

2. #### Google & Chrome:
    - 96x96: GoogleTV
    - 128x128: Chrome Web Store
    - 196x196: Android Chrome
    - 256x256: Desktop Chrome
    - 384x384: Desktop+ Chrome

3. #### Internet Explorer:
    - 24x24: Pinned site

4. #### Windows 8.1:
    - 128x128: Small size Metro Tile
    - 270x270: Medium size Metro Tile
    - 558x558: Metro Tile
    - 558x270: Wide Metro Tile

    We also need a configuration file called `browserconfig.xml` located in the root of our project. It looks like this:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <browserconfig>
        <msapplication>
            <tile>
                <square70x70logo src="favicon-128x128.png" />
                <square150x150logo src="favicon-270x270.png" />
                <wide310x150logo src="favicon-558x270.png" />
                <square310x310logo src="favicon-558x558.png" />
                <TileColor>#ffffff</TileColor>
            </tile>
        </msapplication>
    </browserconfig>
    ```

    You can put whatever hex color you want inside the TileColor property, it represents the Windows 8.1 Metro Tile background color.

### Adding the favicons to your website

In your website's HTML file head you will need to insert these link tags:
```html
<!-- ... All your Apple favicons in ascending order of size -->
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="favicon-57x57.png" sizes="57x57" type="image/png">

<!-- ... All your favicons in ascending order of size -->
<link rel="icon" href="favicon-16x16.png" sizes="16x16" type="image/png" />

<!-- Your svg favicon in case you have one -->
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.svg" sizes="any" type="image/svg+xml" />

<!-- Your favicon.ico in case you have one -->
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="16x16 32x32 64x64" type="image/x-icon" />
```

**You must respect the order shown, that's how browsers load the favicons in best use cases.**

### How to setup Progressive Web Apps

I'm really sorry, but you will need only 2 more favicons: `192x192` and `512x512`.

Jokes aside, setting up a PWA can sound hard, but in this section I will prove that wrong.

First we need to create a file called `manifest.webmanifest` or `manifest.json`, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest#create" target="_blank">both are valid</a>. Next we have to consider the properties of this file, whose are:

- `name`: used when the app is installed.
- `short_name`: used on the user's home screen, launcher, or other places where space is limited.
- `description`: used to describe the purpose of your app, with a maximum of 300 characters.
- `theme_color`: used to set the color of the tool bar, can be reflected in the app's preview in task switchers.
- `background_color`: used on the splash screen when the application launches on mobile for the first time.
- `display`: used to select which browser UI is shown when the app is launched.
    - `fullscreen`: opens the web app without any browser UI and takes up all of the available display area.
    - `standalone`: opens the web app to look and feel like a standalone app. The app runs in its own window, separate from the browser, and hides standard browser UI elements such as the address bar.
    - `minimal-ui`: This mode is similar to `standalone`, but provides the user with a minimal set of UI elements for controlling navigation, such the as back and reload buttons.
    - `browser`: a standard browser experience.
- `icons`: used to define a set of icons for the browser to use on the home screen, app launcher, task switcher, splash screen, and other places.

These properties are just for a minimal configuration, you can read more about this topic <a href="https://web.dev/articles/add-manifest" target="_blank">here</a>.

Hence our file would look something like this:
```jsonc
{
    "name": "Lorem ipsum: dolor sit amet",
    "short_name": "Lorem ipsum",
    "description": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit...",
    "theme_color": "#ffffff",
    "background_color": "#ffffff",
    "display": "standalone",
    "icons": [
        // ... Your other favicons
        { "src": "favicon-192x192.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192"},
        { "src": "favicon-512x512.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "512x512"}
    ]
}
```

### A small recommendation

Weeks ago I faced this thing where you need to convert your logo to +20 sizes and manually create the PWA manifest, it was horrific. So I created a lightweight CLI that does all of that for you, it's called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/favgen-cli" target="_blank">favgen-cli</a>.

You can try it now using your favourite package manager such as npm, pnpm and bun. Use `npx favgen-cli` | `pnpm dlx favgen-cli` | `bunx favgen-cli`.
